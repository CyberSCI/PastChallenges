## Backstory

> Val Verde is an impoverished Central American nation rich in natural resources. With general elections just a few months away, global political and business players are using their technological superiority to sabotage its electoral process and install their puppet candidates in positions of power. Central Electoral Commission computers, voter registry, and political party offices have all become targets of hacking, spying and sabotage. Your team of cybersecurity experts is hired by the Valverdian government in a last-ditch attempt to protect its computer systems in the run-up to voting day. Your task is to go toe to toe with some of the world's most skilled APTs and defend the nation's fragile democracy. Are you up to the challenge?
