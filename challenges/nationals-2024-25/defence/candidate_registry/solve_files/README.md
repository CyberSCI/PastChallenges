## App Design

Val Verde is on the frontier of AI development. Our expert AI devs vibe coded their way to a vulnerability free codebase.

The code is broken into:
1. Frontend (javascript)
2. Backend (Golang) + sqlite DB

We use docker compose to spin up and down the app

> docker compose up 

> docker compose down

> docker compose build

> docker compose logs -f
