### Description:

Elections Val Verde  continues to strive to modernize our platforms and services, unveiling new services that make election information accessible to citizens and modernize our internal polling tracking and analytics, and as well as providing this service to third parties.

Unfortunately we uncovered some suspicious activity in our logs when rolling out this new platform.  Can you uncover evidence of an attack occuring?

### Scenario:

- An attacker targets the site that collects and displays election stats


### Challenge Pitch:

Give players an Elasticsearch log archive and a docker file, and they will have to use Kibana to "find the bad". Create a fake elections network, and generate traffic for it. Players will have to search the logs to find IOCs


Work Items:
- Alot lol ;)

Files:
- An archive
